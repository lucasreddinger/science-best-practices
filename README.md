# Open data and source-code in science (specifically, economics)

We may all find something to learn from [Zenodo's principles](https://about.zenodo.org/principles/).

## Licensing

Difference license styles should be used for data and source-code.

**Source:** The [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), [BSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses), and [OpenBSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) are permissive, attribution-only licenses suitable for source-code.

**Data:** [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) is an attribution-only license suitable for data and creative works.

## Data and source-code repository platforms

As long as research articles persist, so should the respective data and source-code. Accordingly, one may wish to consider the lifetime of repositories.

All of the respoitories below issue DOIs.

[**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/) is operated by CERN, backed by the EU.

- Deposits can have open, closed, restricted, or embargoed access.
- Deposit raw filescan be accessed directly via a permanent URI.
- Once files are published, they may only be removed in truly exceptional cases.
- See: [Policies](https://about.zenodo.org/policies/), [FAQ](https://help.zenodo.org/faq/)

[**Open Science Framework (OSF)**](https://osf.io/) is a platform operated by the [Center for Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science), a non-profit.

- Deposits raw files can be accessed directly via a permanent URI.
- Allows modifications and removal of any files.

[**openICPSR**](https://www.openicpsr.org/) depends on infrastructure hosted by the University of Michigan.  [The service had an outage on 2023-08-27](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/posts/2023-08-29-notice-downtime) which may call into question their reliability and perhaps even longevity.

- Allows modifications and unpublishing (retains metadata but will not allow access to the files).
- See: [FAQ](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/faqs)

[**The AEA Data and Code Repository**](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea) is a branded repository hosted by ICPSR on the same platform.

**arXiv** is the (i.e., my) preferred repository for the fields it services (including economics). It is operated by Cornell University.

**SocArXiv** serves social sciences, humanities, education, and law. It is operated by the Center for Open Science and is integrated with OSF. It's a bit easier to use than arXiv, as it allows PDF uploads (as opposed to LaTeX packages).

**SSRN** should be avoided, as it is privately owned.
